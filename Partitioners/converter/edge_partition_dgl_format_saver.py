edge_partition_dgl_format_saver.py
==================================

Save a graph partitioned by EDGE-ASSIGNMENT (vertex-cut) into the DGL
on-disk partition format, symmetric to `save_partition_graph` from
`node_partition_dgl_format_saver`.

Targets DGL 2.5; layout follows the convention used by
`dgl.distributed.partition.partition_graph` (from which the original
node-partition saver was adapted).

Scope
-----
- **Homogeneous graphs only.** Uses DGL's canonical `_N` / `_N:_E:_N`
  type names in the metadata JSON, matching what `dgl.distributed`
  expects for a single-type graph.
- **True vertex-cut.** Every edge belongs to exactly one partition
  (as given by `edge_part`). Nodes are replicated: each partition
  receives all endpoints of its edges, with exactly one copy marked
  as the master (`inner_node=1`) and the rest as mirrors.

Master selection
----------------
Vertex-cut needs *one* master copy per node so that node_map can express
contiguous per-partition ID ranges and features have a single physical
home. The master rule follows the common convention from PowerGraph /
GraphX / DistGNN: the master is the partition that holds the most
incident edges of the node; ties are broken by the smallest partition
ID. Override via `master_rule` if you need a different policy.

Local node ordering inside each partition
-----------------------------------------
Each partition's local node ID space is laid out as

    [ masters of p, in ascending reshuffled-NID order ]
    [ mirrors of p, in ascending reshuffled-NID order ]

which guarantees that:
  * `inner_node==1` rows occupy local IDs `[0, n_master)`,
  * the order of master rows matches the slice taken from the global
    feature tensors when writing `node_feat.dgl`,
  * the order of edge rows in `sg.edata` matches the slice taken from
    the global feature tensors when writing `edge_feat.dgl`.

This is the alignment invariant that DGL's `DistGraph` loader assumes.

On-disk layout
--------------
    out_path/
      graph_name.json
      part0/
        graph.dgl        # DGLGraph with structural ndata/edata only
        node_feat.dgl    # tensors for master nodes only
        edge_feat.dgl    # tensors for edges assigned to this partition
        drpa_meta.pt     # OPTIONAL: DRPA metadata (only when
                         #           write_drpa_meta=True)

Structural fields on each subgraph:
    ndata[dgl.NID]       reshuffled global node IDs
    ndata['inner_node']  uint8, 1 iff master of this partition
    ndata['part_id']     master-partition of each node (owner)
    edata[dgl.EID]       reshuffled global edge IDs
    edata['inner_edge']  uint8, always 1 in vertex-cut (every edge
                         in the subgraph was assigned to this part)


DRPA metadata (opt-in)
----------------------
When `write_drpa_meta=True`, an extra `part{p}/drpa_meta.pt` file is
written per partition, holding the tensors the DGL_XEON DRPA (Delayed
Remote Partial Aggregation) C++ kernels consume -- `node_map`, `adj`,
`lf` -- plus `orig_nid`, a per-local-node map back to the original
graph's node space (used by the training script's --validate-drpa
correctness check). See the `write_drpa_metadata` docstring and the
format specification document for details.

NOTE: DRPA's `node_map` is a DIFFERENT object from the
`metadata["node_map"]["_N"]` written into the graph JSON. The JSON one
holds per-partition *master* ranges (DistDGL convention); the DRPA one
holds the cumulative *total* node count per partition (Libra address
space). Both are emitted; they must not be confused.


Implementation notes (memory-optimised rewrite)
-----------------------------------------------
This file produces the same on-disk output as the previous version but
avoids two major memory blow-ups that hurt on graphs the size of
ogbn-papers100M (~111M nodes, ~1.6B edges, ~57GB of node features):

1. The reshuffled global graph is no longer materialised as a DGLGraph
   with reordered ndata/edata. Doing so doubled every feature tensor
   in memory because both `g` (held by the caller) and `g_r` carried
   full copies. Instead we keep just two integer arrays
   (``new_src_np``, ``new_dst_np``) plus the permutations
   ``new_to_old_nid`` / ``new_to_old_eid``, and slice features directly
   out of ``g.ndata[k]`` / ``g.edata[k]`` using composed indices.

2. The per-partition ``g2l`` lookup buffer (length = num_nodes) is now
   allocated once and reset only at the indices that were touched in
   the previous iteration, instead of being reallocated per partition.
   On papers100M this saves a ~890MB allocation/free per partition.

The 3-key lexsort during reshuffle is preserved because the
within-partition (src, dst) ordering it produces is the same ordering
DGL writes when it builds an edge-cut partition; downstream tools that
inspect the on-disk COO will see a layout consistent with that.

# DRPA metadata writer
# ====================================================================
#
# Produces, for each partition, a `drpa_meta.pt` file with the three
# tensors the DGL_XEON DRPA C++ kernels consume:
#
#     node_map : int32, shape (num_parts,)
#     adj      : int32, shape (n_total_p, num_parts - 1)
#     lf       : int32, shape (n_total_p,)
#
# Address space ("Libra address space")
# --------------------------------------
# DRPA does NOT use the reshuffled-NID space and does NOT use the
# DistDGL `node_map` (per-partition master ranges) in the graph JSON.
# It uses:
#
#     global_libra_id(p, local_idx) = node_map[p - 1] + local_idx
#                                     (node_map[-1] == 0 for p == 0)
#
# where `node_map` is the cumulative sum of the *total* node count
# (masters + mirrors) of each partition. Derived directly from the C++:
#
#   node2partition()    : returns first p with `val < node_map[p]`
#                         => node_map = cumulative EXCLUSIVE upper bounds
#   map2local_index_()  : local_idx = global_id - node_map[pid - 1]
#                         => offset of partition pid is node_map[pid-1]

def _choose_leader(reshuffled_nid, copy_parts, master_part):
    """
    Pick the leader partition for one global node: the leader is always
    the node's MASTER partition.

    Why the master, and not a free choice among copies
    ---------------------------------------------------
    DRPA's scatter_reduce_v41 aggregates the gathered remote embeddings
    into `feat[local_index]` of the LEADER copy, and scatter_reduce_v42
    then redistributes from there. If the leader is a mirror, the fully
    aggregated embedding ends up in a mirror row and the master copy
    never receives it -- which makes the master's embedding wrong
    (confirmed empirically: with a free leader choice, ~69% of leaders
    were mirrors and the DRPA forward diverged from the single-machine
    forward).

    Making the leader the master is also automatically globally
    consistent: every node has exactly one master partition, and every
    partition holding a copy computes the same answer from master_part.
    No seed / RNG is needed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reshuffled_nid : int
        Reshuffled global NID of the node (kept for signature stability
        and debugging; not used for the choice).
